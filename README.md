##Idea:
A system for students that they can book office hours with professors/TAs.
We think that it matches with all the requirements.

For phase 2 (the actual coding part), to set up the app, go to the app/app_name folder, and first [install ```gulp```,  ```grunt-cli```,  ```bower``` globally with ```npm```](http://meanjs.org/docs.html#getting-started). After you've done that, in the app directory, 
```bash
npm install
```

(root/superuser access is needed), and then type


```bash
bower install
bower update
```

to get the front-end code, and finally, run the server with 

```bash
gulp
```
to start the server.

See [the MEAN.js docs](http://meanjs.org/docs.html) for more.
